# MLT Ascend
MLT's first program, a predictive stock tool.

# Product Description
Our goal: create an easy to use system with the ability to reveal lucrative opportunities within the stock market. This is achieved through machine learning in order to generate predictive models for user-requested stocks. By using historical market data, active predictions of market trends are calculated using our trained AI program developed in part through Microsoftâ€™s Machine Learning suite. 

- Front-end will use MVC(with Bulma for styling)
- Use of a sorting algorithm, to allow the User to filter by column category. 
- Using .NET Core and ML.NET
- Using historical stock market data from an API to make active predictions
- T-SQL to store user predictions.
