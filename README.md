# MLT Ascend
MLT's first program, a predictive stock tool.

# Product Description
Our goal: create an easy to use system with the ability to reveal lucrative opportunities within the stock market. This is achieved through machine learning in order to generate predictive models for user-requested stocks. By using historical market data, active predictions of market trends are calculated using our trained AI program developed in part through Microsoftâ€™s Machine Learning suite. 

## Features
- Front-end using ASP.NET MVC(with Bulma for styling)
- A sorting algorithm to allow the User to filter by column category. 
- Predictions made using ML.NET and historical stock market data from IEX Trading API and AlphaVantage API
- Entity Framework and Microsoft SQL Server to store user predictions.
