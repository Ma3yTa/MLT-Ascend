# Product Description
Our goal: create an easy to use system with the ability to reveal lucrative opportunities within the stock market. This is achieved through machine learning in order to generate predictive models for user-requested stocks. By using historical market data, active predictions of market trends are calculated using our trained AI program developed in part through Microsoft’s Machine Learning suite.

-Use of a sorting algorithm, to allow the User to filter by column category. 
-Using .NET Core, ML.Net, and other aspects of Microsoft’s Machine Learning suite
-Using historical stock market data from an API to make active predictions
